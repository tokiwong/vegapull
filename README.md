# 👒 vegapull

![build](https://github.com/coko7/vegapull/actions/workflows/rust.yml/badge.svg)

A CLI utility to retrieve data for the One Piece Trading Cards Game (TCG).

## Where is the data?

For practical reasons, data is kept in a separate repository: https://github.com/Coko7/vegapull-records

## How to use?

1. Install / build from source:
```console
coko7@example:~$ git clone https://github.com/Coko7/vegapull.git
coko7@example:~$ cd vegapull 
coko7@example:~$ cargo build --release
```
2. Use
```console
coko7@example:~$ vegapull -h
Dynamically fetch data for the One Piece TCG from official sites.

Usage: vegapull [OPTIONS] <COMMAND>

Commands:
  packs   Get the list of all existing packs
  cards   Get all cards within the given pack
  images  Download all card images for a given pack
  inter   Launch into interactive mode
  help    Print this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)

Options:
  -l, --language <LANGUAGE>  Language to use for the data [default: english] [possible values: chinese-hongkong, chinese-simplified, chinese-taiwan, english, english-asia, japanese, thai]
  -v, --verbose...           Increase logging verbosity
  -q, --quiet...             Decrease logging verbosity
  -h, --help                 Print help
```

3. You can also use the small bash script `pull_all.sh` that uses the `vegapull` CLI to download data for all existing packs:
```console
coko7@example:~$ bash pull_all.sh
```

#[derive(Debug, Deserialize, Serialize)]
pub struct Card {
    pub id: String,

## 🐛 Issues

When using `jp` locale to fetch data, the scraper will likely fail when handling `counter` or `colors` values for some cards.

## 🗺️ Road Map

- [x] Fetch card sets data
- [x] Better error handling
- [x] Fetch cards data for each card set (wip)
- [x] Get card data for all card sets
- [x] Organize and save cards data as JSON to files
- [x] Add logs
- [x] Support more card fields
- [x] Download card images as well
- [x] Make it locale-agnostic to be able to download data from Japanese and other versions
    - [ ] Handle problems with the `jp` version (inconsistent cards data on official site)
- [ ] Better configuration 
- [x] User friendly CLI
- [ ] Add tests
